There are multiple tools out there that can help create and manage virtual environments. In our case, We used two tools *VirtualBox and Vagrant*:

- *VirtualBox* is a free and lightweight Virtual Machine provider.

- *Vagrant* is a tool that sits on top of a VM provider. Just like VirtualBox, we choose to use Vagrant because it is free, reliable and well maintained. Keep in mind that the purpose here is to use Virtual environments, and both VirtualBox and Vagrant are just means to achieve this purpose.
